# Installation Steps for XCompact3d on TAMU Faster HPC

```bash
# 1. Login to Faster
ssh NetID@faster.hprc.tamu.edu

# 2. Create and enter directory
cd $HOME
mkdir xcompact3d && cd xcompact3d

# 3. Load required modules
module purge
module load GCCcore/11.3.0
module load CMake/3.29.3
module load gompi/2023a

# 4. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d
cd Incompact3d

# 5. Set Fortran compiler
export FC=mpif90

# 6. Configure and build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j 8

# The executable will be in build/bin/xcompact3d
```

Notes:
- Make sure to replace 'NetID' with your TAMU NetID
- The build process might take a few minutes
- Successful build will create executable at `build/bin/xcompact3d`
- For running tests, you'll need Python with NumPy installed
