# XCompact3d Installation Guide for NREL Kestrel HPC

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing XCompact3d on the NREL Kestrel HPC system.

## Prerequisites
- Access to NREL Kestrel HPC system
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands
- Your Kestrel username and credentials

## Installation Steps

### 1. Login to Kestrel
```bash
ssh username@kestrel.hpc.nrel.gov
```
Replace `username` with your Kestrel username.

### 2. Create Installation Directory
```bash
cd $HOME
mkdir xcompact3d && cd xcompact3d
```

### 3. Load Required Modules
```bash
# Clear any previously loaded modules
module purge

# Load required modules in this specific order
module load intel-oneapi-compilers
module load intel-oneapi-mpi
module load intel-oneapi-mkl
module load cmake
```

### 4. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d
cd Incompact3d
```

### 5. Configure and Build
```bash
# Set the Fortran compiler
export FC=mpiifort

# Configure the build
cmake -S . -B build

# Build using 8 cores (adjust number as needed)
cmake --build build -j 8
```

### 6. Verify Installation
After successful compilation, the executable should be located at:
```bash
ls -l build/bin/xcompact3d
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. If you get MKL-related errors during configuration:
   - Make sure you loaded the `intel-oneapi-mkl` module
   - Verify all modules are loaded in the correct order

2. If you see compiler warnings about Intel Fortran Compiler Classic (ifort):
   - These are deprecation warnings and can be safely ignored for now
   - The compiler will be supported through late 2024

## Module Requirements
- intel-oneapi-compilers
- intel-oneapi-mpi
- intel-oneapi-mkl
- cmake

## Additional Notes

1. The installation uses Intel's OneAPI toolchain, which is optimized for Kestrel's architecture.
2. The build process includes the 2decomp-fft library automatically.
3. Python with NumPy is required for running validation tests.
